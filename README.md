# Div Battles

The Div Battles plug-in "battles" two divs of your choosing on an html page. The 2 divs will initially shake and then rush each other toward a convergence point you select.

NOTE: This plug-in is best suited for 2 divs that are placed apart from one another left and right with at least some space in-between them.

---

## Install

Copy the `battle.js` in your project folder.

Include script tags at the end of your body tag to load in the jQuery and the file. Ex:

```html
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="battle.js"></script>
</body>
```
Note: You may need to change the src location of `battle.js` depending on where you copy the file.


##Usage

Select the two divs you want to use for the battle. Give the left div an ID of "battle1" and the right div an ID of "battle2". Find a convergence point (the point where the divs will collide) on your page and give it an ID of "conv". If any of these divs already have IDs you may use the existing ID(s) by updating the settings.... More to come here!!!!
